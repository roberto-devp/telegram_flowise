# Telegram Bot Flowise
Flowise Telegram Bot ðŸ¤– with Langchain Technology
This Telegram bot leverages Flowise API calls, providing a myriad of possibilities through Langchain technology.

As a non-coder, I've observed various Telegram bots integrating with n8n, Make, and Activepieces. However, I believe that fewer integrations can lead to fewer issues. Therefore, I embarked on creating my own Telegram bot using Flowise, with assistance from ChatGPT and my limited programming knowledge, until I successfully got it up and running.

I've decided to share this bot with the community, in the hopes that it may undergo further modifications. If you'd like to contribute to its improvement, you are more than welcome!
